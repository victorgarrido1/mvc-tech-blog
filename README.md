# mvc-tech-blog
This repository is a CMS-style tech blog site similar to a Wordpress site.

This application demonstrates the use of seeing members of a website share tech related content and blog posts. 
This assignment was made by using the MVC features. As many developers spend their time reading documentation and other information relating to their field.
They can use this site to sign up for a account and share their own Blogs on their site. This app follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## What I've learned from this Project
This project helped me with a great grasp of understanding of the handlebar template language to be able to move between page to page. Using the syntax that handlebars has helped me understand how it connects with the Sequelize data and how we hash out passwords for the safety of the user and how the page works whenever as a developer the logic of employing logic to be able to move page to page and how it can be used to data how we'd like to manipulate it. With this tech blog site. The user does have a ability to be able to share comments alongside editing the page and as well as deleting the post completely from the blog.

As with web development. There is always opportunity to continue to grow form base understanding and expand website features and design. There is more that I want to be able to understand going forward with this project and that would be to enhance the features of the webpage navigation setup as in its current state. There has been Interesting navigation bugs that have been hard to understand. But I am aware that routers are very important to learn when it comes to be able to make user navigation easy and simple for the user.
